# Preliminaries
Physics is, at heart, an experimental science. This means that physicists work with data. This course is aimed at providing you theoretical and practical tools to do so. We will cover basic concepts techniques for analyzing data and deriving quantitative insights from it.

## What you need to know
This course is intended for graduate students, or students in the last year of the Bachelors degree.
You will need to have a basic working knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and probability.
In addition, basic scripting capabilities would be very useful in this course. You may work in any language you prefer, even annoying ones like MATLAB, but code examples will be given in python.

## Waiver: what these notes are, and what they are not
The course takes relevant bits from various textbooks, that will be referenced throughout and are in general a much better way to learn (IMHO) than courses. I highly recommend going to the textbooks (most of them are freely available online, the others are in the library) when something sparks your curiosity.

These are lecture notes that I wrote while preparing the course, as a reference for myself. It is not (yet?) a textbook. I chose to make them available with the intent of making the material more accessible, and because I believe open-sourcing stuff is good practice. The notes and the source code are freely available on github, but at the same time they come with no warranty: they surely contain typos and inconsistent notation, and maybe also (but hopefully not) worse inaccuracies. If you find typos, errors and mistakes please report them on the github repository.

```{admonition} Bonus credit
:class: tip
You can submit corrections to the notes by opening a pull request or an issue on Github
The student that will submit the most approved pull requests will get a 5-points bonus to the final grade.

## Inspiration
The notes were formatted in this online book format with the help Dr. [Barak Hirshberg](https://hirshberg-group.webflow.io/) from the School of Chemistry in Tel Aviv University. His excellent notes in his excellent [Molecular Dynamics course](https://barakhirshberg.github.io/MolecularSimulations) were the main reason I ended up writing my notes like this too. 

The content is rendered by the [`jupyter-book` package](https://jupyterbook.org/).
