# Introduction


## What you need to know
This course is intended for graduate students, or students in the last year of the Bachelors degree.
You will need to have a basic working knowledge of calculus, linear algebra and probability.
In addition, basic scripting capabilities would be very useful in this course. You may work in any language you prefer, even annoying ones like MATLAB, but code examples will be given in python.

:class: tip
This course will also feature a competition, how exciting!
While you read the notes, will undoubtedly find typos, errors and mistakes.
You can submit corrections to the notes by opening a pull request on Github (more about this later).
The person that will submit the most approved pull requests will get a 5-points bonus to the final grade.
Hint: find one deliberate typo in this page to practice on.

## Inspiration
The notes were formatted in this online book format with the help Dr. [Barak Hirshberg](https://hirshberg-group.webflow.io/) from the School of Chemistry in Tel Aviv University. His excellent notes in the [Molecular Dynamics course](https://barakhirshberg.github.io/MolecularSimulations) he's giving was the main reason I ended up writing my notes like this too.
